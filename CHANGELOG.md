# Changelog since version 6.12.0

* Added the possibility to select a node directly from the code area.
To use this, hold the CTRL key pressed for a second. The code area should
change colors. In that state, hovering above some text should select the
node to which it corresponds:

* Added a crumb bar that displays the ancestors of the currently selected node.
